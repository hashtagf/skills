# Direction library — pick a look from pictures, not adjectives

Every direction in `assets/directions/directions.json`, in four groups (company, premium, playful, atmospheric), each with
a rendered preview. Palettes, faces and surfaces are
approximations for choosing a look.

Users choose a look faster and more reliably from a picture than from a style
name. In testing, a user asked to see previews of every named direction three
times before choosing. Use this file in phase 3 when a public page, brand or
product needs a new look and DESIGN.md does not fix one. It complements
[design direction](design-direction.md) §7 (named directions), §8 (user words →
style) and §9 (interview).

Each entry is a **starting direction**, not a template. A direction sets
material, type voice and surface; it never changes the page pattern
([design direction](design-direction.md) §1–2). The dials (V · M · D = variance
· motion · density) are suggested starting values; tune them to the brief.

## 1. Procedure

1. **Filter by the subject**, not by taste: use the "Fits" and "Avoid for"
   columns. A company-marketing or B2B page usually starts from the *Company*
   rows; a consumer or youth brand from *Playful*; do not offer a direction in
   "Avoid for" unless the user asks for it.
2. **Shortlist 2-3 with pictures; six is only the cap of one picture sheet.** Previews are generated on demand (not committed; rebuild with
   `node scripts/build_previews.js --only directions`; a no-flag `direction_preview.js --sheet` does the same). Each
   direction has `assets/directions/previews/<id>.jpg`, plus labelled overviews
   per group (`sheet-company.jpg`, `sheet-premium.jpg`, `sheet-playful.jpg`,
   `sheet-atmospheric.jpg`) and `sheet.jpg` with all of them: read the images
   and show them (the sheets are for you to choose from; show the user 2-3 at a time). Each
   direction is drawn in **its own composition** (`comp` in directions.json: one of fourteen
   in `scripts/compositions.js`, each distilled from a page in the
   [reference library](../assets/references/README.md) or the [showcase catalog](../assets/showcase/README.md)) on **content from a real kind of
   business** (`subject`, `assets/directions/content-packs.json`) with open-collection
   photographs (`assets/photos/`). They show a designed first screen and the section under
   it, not a palette swatch. The same direction as product UI (same tokens, admin
   structure) is in `previews/product/<id>-overview.jpg` and `-records.jpg`. Try another
   arrangement or subject, or the user's own copy:
   `node scripts/direction_preview.js --ids dose,riso [--comp c3] [--subject cafe] [--brief "Headline|Sentence|Button"] [--sheet] --out <project>/previews`.
   With `--ids`, `--subject`, `--comp` or `--brief` the pictures go to `--out` (or a printed temp folder when it is
   left out), never over `assets/directions/previews/`, which `look.py` serves. Unknown ids, compositions or
   subjects stop the run (exit 2).
   **A shortlist differs in layout, not only colour.** Several directions share a composition (Dose, Cobalt,
   Coral and Fjord are all `c5`), so their stored previews are the same page in other colours. Render the shortlist
   with `--ids` (the script gives later picks the next unused composition and says so; `--same-comp` keeps them)
   and with `--subject <client kind>` (packs include `dental`, `clinic`, `cafe` …) so every option shows the client's world
   (a subject without photographs, such as `saas` or `data`, is only moved to a composition that needs none);
   Without a preview, render a one-screen sketch yourself; never describe looks in words only.
3. **Say what each costs**: one line on risk for this subject, and which one you
   recommend and why. Lead with the recommendation.
4. **Ask once** (host question tool; this is Round C of the interview in
   [design direction](design-direction.md) §9, per [design workflow](design-workflow.md) "Asking well"). When the user asks for "more", show the next 2-3 from the
   other groups; never repeat shown ones.
5. **Record the choice** in the design context card: direction, dials, ground
   (light/dark), the Thai type pair ([visual system](visual-system.md) Part A
   "Thai with Latin display faces") and one sentence on why it fits.
6. **Keep the previous version.** A direction change replaces the look; copy the
   existing files first ([design workflow](design-workflow.md) phase 5) so the
   user can compare.

Provide preview images only for the directions you actually offer; a preview of
a direction the user did not ask about is noise.

### Preview sets (rebuild with `node scripts/build_previews.js`)

| Set | Script | Folder | Shows |
|---|---|---|---|
| directions | `direction_preview.js --sheet` | `assets/directions/previews/` | each direction in its composition on a subject, plus group sheets |
| brand | `backoffice_preview.js --direction all` | `previews/product/` | the same direction as product UI (overview, records) |
| backoffice, mobile, tablet, rtl | `backoffice_preview.js` | `assets/backoffice/previews/…` | admin looks, density, phone, 820px tablet, mirrored layout |

Judge a direction on a dense table and a form too, not only a hero: look at its product
previews before choosing. Dark variants of a light direction come from
`python3 scripts/export_tokens.py <id> --print-dark`.

### Shape language

Previews differ in shape, not only colour, so a look is not read as "boxes with
a different palette". `directions.json` carries, per direction: `radius` (cards),
`btn` (pill, round or square), `corner` (even, leaf with asymmetric corners,
arch, or cut with a clipped corner), `art` (blocks, circle, stack, grid, lines
and the curved set blob, arch, wave, tilt, dots, diag, rings, pill) and `hero`
(settled, split, band and giant type, full-bleed with a panel, staggered tilted
tiles, arch frame). About half the directions are sharp (radius 0) because
their material is print, poster or technical; the rest are rounded, arched,
wavy or tilted. A direction should state its shape rule on the context card
("pill buttons, leaf-cornered cards, arch hero") so soft or sharp is a decision,
not a default.

### Adding or changing a direction

Add an entry to `assets/directions/directions.json` (id, group, ground, surface,
ink, muted, accent, accentInk, four tints, display and body Google Fonts
families, weight, case, tracking, radius, `btn`, `corner`, `surf` = flat · outline ·
offset · lift · plastic · sticker · paper, `hero` and `art` (see Shape language)), run `scripts/direction_preview.js --ids <id> --sheet`,
look at the picture, and add a row to §2. A preview is a sketch of the material,
not a finished page: check the real direction on a rendered page of the
project before delivery. The faces in the file are Google-Fonts approximations
of each direction's real faces.

## 3. Choosing for company marketing

When the user says "company", "corporate" or "marketing company" without more:

- **Premium and friendly (the usual agency brief: "premium + playful")**: start
  here, with rounded or mixed shapes: Petal, Opal, Honey, Fjord, Velvet, Sorbet,
  Dose, Atelier. A sharp print look (Riso, Werkstatt, Grid) is not the answer to
  "friendly".
- **Professional with warmth** (most agencies): Dose, Terrazzo, Studio, Editorial.
- **Professional with a point of view**: Riso, Werkstatt, Grid, Loom (if photos exist).
- **Techy or data-led**: Cobalt, Almanac, Midnight.
- **Every set of three recommendations includes at least one rounded or mixed
  direction.** Do not offer three square ones, and say which of the three is the
  softest.
- Offer one playful option (Paste-up or Sticker) only to show the range, and say
  that it trades trust for personality.

## 4. After the choice

- Map the chosen direction to tokens before writing markup: ground, ink, one
  accent, type pair (Latin + Thai), radius camp, surface rule (tone steps,
  hairlines or shadows), motion level.
- **Check the shape against the subject before using the recipe's radius.** The
  recipe (`direction_recipe.py`) gives a default radius camp; list 3–5 objects from
  the client's world ([design quality](design-quality.md) §1 Subject shapes) and keep
  the recipe's corners only when they agree. Loom is square because its material is
  print; a café drawn in Loom keeps Loom's paper, ink and serif but takes round
  shapes from the bean, cup and bag. Record the decision in DESIGN.md Shapes.
- Write the rules the direction forbids on the context card (for example
  "no soft shadows on controls", "red is never a warning").
- External skills may carry the same directions with stricter rules; follow the
  precedence in [design memory](design-memory.md) §2 and §5.
