# Accounts, onboarding and settings

Original illustrative layouts for adaptation, not validated production designs.
Read [the selection guide](index.md) before choosing a pattern. Boxes indicate
content groups and priority, not fixed pixel geometry or implementation components.
Use [the shared specification](specification.md) for accessibility, states and tokens.

**Task:** Access an account and recover from failure.

**Avoid / adapt:** Avoid disabling password-manager or paste workflows.

**Acceptance example:** Check authentication and recovery with assistive tools and preserved safe input.

**Customize:** Substitute real content, labels and permission rules; apply existing
tokens and the actual data model. Record why this structure serves the user task.

## U02: Setup onboarding

**Task:** Reach a first useful result with necessary preparation.

**Wide layout:**

```text
Purpose + prerequisites | Progress
Current setup task | Example/help
Back/continue | Skip where meaningful
```

**Applicable states:** Not started; partial; validation; save failure; completed.

**Avoid / adapt:** Avoid mandatory tours unrelated to the user's goal.

**Acceptance example:** Check resumption, optional-task handling and an actual useful completion.
