# Administration and back office

Original illustrative layouts for adaptation, not validated production designs.
Read [the selection guide](index.md) before choosing a pattern. Boxes indicate
content groups and priority, not fixed pixel geometry or implementation components.
Use [the shared specification](specification.md) for accessibility, states and tokens.

## A01: Record management

**Task:** Search, select and act on many records.

**Wide layout:**

```text
Workspace navigation | Search + filters
Table + selection | Bulk actions
Pagination | Record detail route
```

**Compact behavior:** Keep key identifiers and actions; offer details without losing filters.

**Applicable states:** Empty; filtered empty; loading; selection; bulk partial failure.

**Avoid / adapt:** Avoid ambiguous select-all scope and silently discarded selections.

**Acceptance example:** Check page-only vs all-matching selection and partial-result recovery.

**Customize:** Substitute real content, labels and permission rules; apply existing
tokens and the actual data model. Record why this structure serves the user task.

## A02: Record detail

**Task:** Understand and edit one object with its history.

**Wide layout:**

```text
Object identity + status | Main actions
Details | Related items
Activity/history | Edit or archive route
```

**Compact behavior:** Stack identity/actions, details and history; preserve return context.

**Applicable states:** Read-only; editing; unsaved; conflict; archived.

**Avoid / adapt:** Avoid treating history as editable current state.

**Acceptance example:** Check edits, permissions, concurrency handling and return to prior list.

**Customize:** Substitute real content, labels and permission rules; apply existing
tokens and the actual data model. Record why this structure serves the user task.

## A03: Approval workbench

**Task:** Review evidence and approve or reject a request.

**Wide layout:**

```text
Review queue | Selected request
Evidence + policy context | Decision panel
Reason + consequences | Audit history
```

**Compact behavior:** Separate reading from final decision; keep evidence accessible.

**Applicable states:** Assigned/unassigned; missing evidence; decided; concurrent decision.

**Avoid / adapt:** Avoid one-click irreversible decisions without context.

**Acceptance example:** Check authority, recorded rationale and no accidental repeat decision.

**Customize:** Substitute real content, labels and permission rules; apply existing
tokens and the actual data model. Record why this structure serves the user task.

## A04: Access management

**Task:** Assign roles and understand the resulting access.

**Wide layout:**

```text
Member list | Invite
Selected member | Role and permission summary
Changes preview | Apply + history
```

**Compact behavior:** Focus each edit on one member or clearly defined selection.

**Applicable states:** Pending invite; revoked; unauthorized; save failure.

**Avoid / adapt:** Avoid showing an editable control users cannot legitimately apply.

**Acceptance example:** Check effective permission changes and prevention of unintended lockout.

**Customize:** Substitute real content, labels and permission rules; apply existing
tokens and the actual data model. Record why this structure serves the user task.

## A05: Import wizard

**Task:** Map data and review effects before applying an import.

**Wide layout:**

```text
File + requirements | Upload
Column mapping | Validation results
Preview changes | Import status + result
```

**Compact behavior:** Use steps with back navigation and retained mappings.

**Applicable states:** Invalid file; mapping error; partial rows; pending; partial result.

**Avoid / adapt:** Avoid importing before consequences and rejected rows are visible.

**Acceptance example:** Check mapping, duplicate policy, resumable recovery and rejected-row reporting.

**Customize:** Substitute real content, labels and permission rules; apply existing
tokens and the actual data model. Record why this structure serves the user task.
