# Content, learning and discovery

Original illustrative layouts for adaptation, not validated production designs.
Read [the selection guide](index.md) before choosing a pattern. Boxes indicate
content groups and priority, not fixed pixel geometry or implementation components.
Use [the shared specification](specification.md) for accessibility, states and tokens.

Next/previous | Help and completion status
```
